# Face-Generator-with-Generative-Adversarial-Networks
A fully explained approach on how to generate faces using GAN from scratch.

The project is developed using Tensorflow 2.0. to Implement a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) from scratch in Python using TensorFlow and Keras.
Using two different Kaggle datasets that contain human face images, and Anime character faces, a GAN is trained that is able to generate human faces and Anime faces (soon).
The main aim is to understand all the concepts and functions required to train a GAN from basics.
